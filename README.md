Hello I am Hanshita khare I have made this Frontend project using HTML/CSS Js.

This project is a web-based note-taking application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an intuitive interface where users can create and manage note groups by selecting custom background colors. Each group allows users to add notes, which include timestamps for when they were created. The application provides an interactive experience with a sticky "Add" button that opens a popup for creating new groups and adding notes. The popup automatically closes if the user clicks outside of it. This project demonstrates the capabilities of front-end technologies to build a dynamic and user-friendly web application without the need for a backend server.
